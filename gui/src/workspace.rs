//! Which workspaces this radio has, derived from what it says it is.
//!
//! The accepted design (option 3, "Workspace") makes the tab bar a
//! **statement about the radio** rather than a fixed menu: a radio with no
//! memory has no MEMORY tab, and the counts in the labels come from the
//! capability set rather than from a constant somebody has to remember to
//! change. The same derivation drives the TUI, which is what makes ADR
//! 0013's parity rule cheap to keep rather than a thing to police.
